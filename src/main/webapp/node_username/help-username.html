		Please insert your machine's username, so Jenkins is able to to find the matching login keychain.<br/>
		<br/>
		Why does this plugin need access to my login keychain?<br/>
		<br/>
		Xcode expects to find code signing identities (private key + certificate) in one of your keychains. The login
		keychain is your default keychain for storing this kind of information and if you've imported a developer identity
		some time before, it's probably stored in this keychain.<br/><br/>
		If you want to build a iOS project for your device, you HAVE to use code signing, so you HAVE to insert your
		credentials here.<br/>
		<br/>
		Future versions:<br/>
		<br/>
		It's planned, that this plugin will give you the possibility to manage the whole code singing stuff (importing
		developer identities, mobile provisioning profiles etc.) from Jenkins' webinterface, so you get rid of some
		really time consuming and bothersome tasks (think of a distributed environment).
