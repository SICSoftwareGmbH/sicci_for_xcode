		This will package your .app bundle into Apple's well known IPA format. The IPA will be stored in the same build
		folder as your .app bundle (eg. "WORKSPACE/build/Debug-iphoneos/").<br/>
		<br/>
		There're three known ways to install IPAs 
		on your device:
		<br/><br/>1. Xcode's Organizer
		<br/>2. iPhone Configuration Utility
		<br/>3. wireless deploy (works for > iOS 4 devices)<br/>
		<br/>
		WARNING:<br/>
		<br/>
		These IPAs won't be removed automatically at the moment, so have a look at your disk space.
